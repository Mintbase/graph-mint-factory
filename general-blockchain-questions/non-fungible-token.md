# Non-fungible token

## **What is a non-fungible token \(NFT\)?**

A [non-fungible token](http://erc721.org/) \(hereafter NFT\) is a special type of cryptographic token whose individual units are essentially non-interchangeable \(non-fungible\).NFTs can represent something physical like a cup of coffee or something digital like airline upgrade points or intellectual property rights. NFTs provide three very important aspects: Digital ownership, interoperability and scarcity. On the Ethereum Virtual Machine, a NFT is also referred to as an [ERC-721](http://erc721.org/) or a collectible.
